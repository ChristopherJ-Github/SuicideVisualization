Although he studied data processing in a technical school he didn't have any work experience in his computer related job. Due to this and his lack of experience in goods management he would often make mistakes. Several co-workers have witnessed his boss telling him that he's lying and that he should just kill himself. 

After he committed suicide many of his co-workers started rumours as to whether it was their boss that caused it.
