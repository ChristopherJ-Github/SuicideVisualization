http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/2024944/full/
In March 2003 Actor Furuoya Masato hung himself.

He would reject roles he didn't like due to his pride in his job. As a result job offers slowly stopped coming in causing Furuoya to worry. When he drank his personality would drastically change as he would inflict violence onto his wife.

As it got tougher to make a living he fell into loan-hell as he ended up with a debt of 300 million yen.
