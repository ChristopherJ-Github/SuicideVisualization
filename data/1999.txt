TOKYO — An employee apparently protesting a forced early retirement became the latest in a rising tide of suicides by middle-aged men in recession-bound Japan, committing the ritual "seppuku" Tuesday outside the company president's office.

The macabre incident, in which Masaharu Nonaka, 58, stabbed himself in the stomach after a meeting with Bridgestone Corp. President Yoichiro Kaizaki, added to a drastic increase in such suicides in the last several months, particularly among down-on-their-luck men. Nationwide, suicides rose 38% to 27,102 in the first 10 months of 1998 (the latest date for which figures are available), compared with the same period the previous year.
