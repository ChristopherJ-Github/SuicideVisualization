Ichiro Oshima, a 24 year-old employee of advertising powerhouse Dentsu, hung himself on August 27, 1991. According to court records, Oshima was responsible for overseeing 40 accounts. His activities involved creating commercials and radio promotion events, as well as chauffering clients to concerts and running errands for them. Over the last 17 months of his life, he worked every day of the week, taking a half day off on just a single occasion. He frequently worked until past 4 A.M., and usually got no more than 2 hours sleep per night before going back to work.

Before his death, Oshima reported to his superior that he was experiencing insomnia, and that he had doubts about his worth as a human.
