http://d.hatena.ne.jp/Chikirin/20100616
Male suicides have increased by 60% in the last 30 years. This is most noticeable in 1998 where only male suicides increase rapidly.

Why have male suicides increased this much? In the same data about gender-specific suicides the reasons for these deaths were listed as well. According to this data reasons for over 74% of these suicides have been found through means of suicide notes, etc. Using this data there is another set of data that puts them into 3 general categories and ranks them.

The top reasons are caused by work and/or economic conditions. Bankruptcy, life struggles, debt, unemployment, business depression, overwork, and change in work environment or work relationships.
